When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work on multiple devices and I want to be able to have all the code anytime.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because sometimes I might work on a feature that might not work with the new changes that others done to the file.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is when I clone a repository from GitHub on GitHub. Clone is when I clone a repository on local computer. 
Branches are branches:))


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To see what changes were made after you stored the last version.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Messages and copy-paste. It would definitely be harder.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Maybe I want to test a new feature but I don't wanna ruin the master branch. I can always return to master ranch if sometimes goes wrong.
