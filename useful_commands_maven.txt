A plugin generally provides a set of goals and which can be executed using following syntax:
-mvn [plugin-name]:[goal-name]

For example, a Java project can be compiled with the maven-compiler-plugin's compile-goal by running following command:
-mvn compiler:compile

Maven uses archetype plugins to create projects. To create a simple java application, we'll use maven-archetype-quickstart plugin. In example below, We'll create a maven based java application project in C:\MVN folder.
