How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was much easier than just going through all the document and see what is wrong with it.
If we know that a previous version was working good, then it is much easier this way!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would be much easier to correct the code in case of some errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: It will have the changes you want to have, when the code is probably running ok.
Cons: You might forget to commit and you will end up with a bunch of code change for different logics.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Google Docs doesen't work with a repository, he works only with files(so with each files at a time).

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can use git log to see the id and the description of the changes.
And after that use the git diff command to compare two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because even if I do a mistake, I can always come back to a previous version where the code worked fine and correct the change that I made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For work.
